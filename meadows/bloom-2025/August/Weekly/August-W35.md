| Symbol |  Dir  | Entry | Exit | Size | PnL  |                                        Notes                                         |
| :----: | :---: | ----: | ---: | ---: | ---: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  AMD   |  Put  |   .88 | 1.07 |    1 |  +19 | Near perfect ORB entry and exit. Held for 2 minutes                                  |
|  TSLA  | Call  |  1.19 | 0.99 |    1 |  -20 | There was no reason to take this "ego" trade pushing for more P&L. Held for too long |

Day PnL: -1.22
Market Sentiment: Unknown
Key Lesson: Played the ORB on AMD very well. Took an unnessesary trade costing me the entire P&L for the day.

|  NVDA  |  Put  |  2.16 | 2.17 |    1 | +.89 | Small scalp on an NVDA drop. Left at the right time before turn over |

Day PnL: +.89
Market Sentiment: Unknown
Key Lesson: Perfect in/out on this trade. Not much of an increase but took no losses for 1 trade.

| Symbol |  Dir  | Entry | Exit | Size | PnL  |                            Notes                             |
| :----: | :---: | ----: | ---: | ---: | ---: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|  TSLA  |  Put  |  2.28 | 2.24 |    1 |   -4 | Stock fell and bounced in the 1 min                          |
|  TLSA  |  Put  |  1.50 | 1.54 |    1 |   +4 | Stock reached a high. Volume for selling was becoming larger |

Day PnL: -22
Market Sentiment: Bullish - SPY & QQQ Dropped a bit on open but remained upwards trend.
Key Lesson: Try to take trades faster when no big spikes in volume towards one side.

| :----: | :---: | ----: | ---: | ---: | ---: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  NVDA  |  Put  |  0.71 | 0.76 |    1 |   +5 | Rode the opening wave. Joined within the 2 mins of market opening.                                                     |
|  SNOW  |  Put  |  1.80 | 1.79 |    1 |   -1 | Miss play on the trade exit. Should of used stop loss got whiplashed back into the red after being green for a moment. |

Day PnL: +3.78
Market Sentiment: Bearish. Spy & QQQ both were in the red at the time of making the trades.
Key Lesson: Watch out for market whiplash. The options price changes faster than the stock price. Got caught due to mechanics. Try not to have this happen anymore by putting propper stop losses.
